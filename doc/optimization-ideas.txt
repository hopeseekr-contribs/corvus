Optimization Ideas
------------------

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Compiler_optimizations

= lexer/paser =

- generate static lexer

- ascii version of lexer/parser. there may be a way to template this.
  work with Ben Hanson on native UChar version

- better mapping of source files to memory, handling encodings (too many 
  conversions now). see clang SourceManager, use llvm memory buffers?

= analysis =

- php level constant folding

= codegen =

- fast function calls when no stack trace is needed: invoke function pointers 
  from IR instead of through runtime. esp. in loops? only with proper arity?

- direct use of i32/64 where possible (loops)

= runtime = 
  
- fast checking of common runtime settings like unicode mode

- store pointer to hash data in pHash, initialized on use. the idea would be
  to allow very cheap empty arrays. this would need some benching to determine
  effectivness
