= Corvus PHP Static Analyzer =

This is a fast (C++ based) PHP static analyzer with few dependencies.
Its purpose is to catch programming errors by statically analyzing the
source code, without running it.

It's meant to be a first code review, generally by being run automatically in
a continuous integration system or even before allowing code to be checked into
a repository.

== Requires ==

 * [http://llvm.org LLVM] 3.0+
 * [http://boost.org Boost] 1.38+
 * [http://cmake.org CMake] 2.6+

== Source ==

Browse the source at:
https://github.com/weyrick/corvus

== Build ==

corvus uses the CMake build system. Basic *nix instructions:

 * create "build" directory inside of corvus/
 * in the build directory, type "cmake .."
 * make

== Status ==

the parser in corvus is based on an earlier project (roadsend-php-raven) and is
quite functional. the analysis passes are, however, still in progress.

corvus can:

 * parse php <= 5.3
 * dump tokens
 * dump AST in XML format
 * parse directories for source code by extension
 * handle include directories
 * build a model based on all source, cache it to a database
 * read YAML based config files
 * be used as a library (callable from e.g. an IDE or commandline tool)
 * report diagnostics on:

 1. in a function signature, using a parameter without a default after a parameter with one e.g. foo($bar, $baz='foo', $bip)
 2. function calls with the wrong number of arguments
 3. calls to nonexistent functions
 4. use of undefined constants

planned:

 * 5.4 source compatibility
 * many more diagnostics, configurable
 * asynchronous parsing
